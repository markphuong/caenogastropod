-- used filtered protein gene models for my initial reference


sbatch blastBatch

first, make an non-interleaved file
make a blastdb of the assembled transcripts
then do blastx and tblastn


sbatch contig_filter_batch

finds best hits and identifies a list of rbbhs
then saves all non-overlapping sequences of the rbbhs, only if the best hit of the non-overlapping sequences is the same protein.

creates '.filtered_results' -- blast info about the contigs you wanted to keep
creates '_phylo_contigs.fa' -- contig file of the sequences that passed the rbbh filter
