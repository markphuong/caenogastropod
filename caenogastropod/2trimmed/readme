########### fix file names for srr reads

sbatch sedbatch
sbatch sedbatch_single

fixes file names for srr reads (needs a /1 and a /2) and moves the original files to srr_reads


######## run trinity, can only run 5 at a time per batch file

split mapfile_caeno (which only contains adnan's samples) into three files to have more assemblies assemble at once


sbatch trinitybatch1
sbatch trinitybatch2
sbatch trinitybatch3
sbatch trinitybatch_single #hinea
sbatch trinitybatch_srr #from sra, different input reads
sbatch trinitybatch_finish #xsede failed, had to do last few samples
