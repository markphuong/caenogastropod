python getreference.py

-- takes every file in /pylon2/bi4s86p/phuong/caenogastropod/8makenewref/newrefs_16/ and opens those fasta files, and generates 'mynewlottiaref.fa'

python make_final_ref.py

-- takes in mynewlottiaref.fa and writes out to final_lottia_ref.fa

any sequences found in Lotgi1..NI and not in mynewlottiaref are written to final_lottia_ref.fa

I do not keep header information, the header is just the Lotgi protein ID #

sbatch blastbatch1
sbatch blastbatch2
sbatch blastbatch3
sbatch blastbatch4
sbatch contig_filter_batch

then do reciprocal blasting and re-generate the phylo contigs files
