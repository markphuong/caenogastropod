need to merge reads for proper coverage estimates
to reran trimmomatic and added flash to it

to create the following files:

1. final1.fq
2. final2.fq
3. finalunpaired.fq
also had trimm and flash output and stderr

did this for 83 samples because hinea is single end

sbatch trim_caeno1
sbatch trim_caeno2
sbatch trim_caeno3
sbatch trim_caeno_ssr
