python makemapfile.py

-- creates mapfile of 250 samples

python makebatchfiles.py

sbatch aliscorebatch0-17 

runs makesomethingNotInterleaved_modified.py

needed to change headers for aliscore to work, so changed all headers to numbers and saved the mapping of the names in:
creates '.namemap' files -- 


after creating the mapfile, it also changes all '-' to '?' for aliscore and creates the '.NI' file
then runs aliscore, which produces the rest of the files.

most important file is the '_List_random.txt', which gives a list of columns to exclude

after running aliscore, you copied ALICUT to the results file and ran it from there

cp ALICUT_V2.3.pl /pylon2/bi4s86p/phuong/caenogastropod/15aliscore/results
perl ALICUT_V2.3.pl 

then typed 's' to start the program and create the 'ALICUT' files


sbatch reformatbatch


reformats all files

some files do not have ALICUT files because no columns/sites were filtered, so processed files depending on that

will wrap around reformatfiles.py

which takes the mapfile, the ALICUT file or the original .NI file, and then outputs the names mapped back and creates '_AA.fasta.aligned.aliscore.filtered.NI'
