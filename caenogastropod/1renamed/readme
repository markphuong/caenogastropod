######## unzip files

sbatch 0unzipreads_caeno

copied all files and renamed the headers. using 0UnzipAllReadsAndRemoveReadsThatFailedIlluminaPipeline.py



######## extra files that I removed or deleted or changed

######## prep adapter files and mapfiles

python make_map_file.py

makes mapfile_caeno by trying to take all the species names of every file and writing it to mapfile_caeno


you got adapters.txt from the bbmap software package (has full list of truseq and nextera adapters from all kits or something)

python add_r.py -- used this script to reverse complement all but the first sequence, and then added all sequences to 'adapters_caeno_7_8_2016.fa'

this script takes:

1. adapters_reversed.fa - I reverse complemented at another website

and creates:

1. adapters_reversed_changed_headers.fa -- added this to 'adapters_caeno_7_8_2016.fa'

this script added an 'r' to every header, because you were able to reverse complement all the sequences, but unable to change the header names.

######### trimmomatic

sbatch trim_caeno
sbatch trim_caeno_single
sbatch trim_caeno_ssr

creates all the 'final1.fq' and 'final2.fq' files

trims files using adapters_caeno_7_8_2016.fa file and puts all unpaired reads into read1 for assembly
